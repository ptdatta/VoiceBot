# VoiceBot

A chatbot with text summarization, emotion detection, and sentiment analysis capabilities.

## Steps to run

1. Clone the repo
2. Download the dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the [model](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.ggmlv3.q8_0.bin). Place it inside the root folder.
4. Run `chainlit run model.py` and detect emotions and summarize texts.

### **Note:**
The model size is 7.16 GB, so it is impossible for me to upload it to GitHub, as I am currently working with the GitHub free plan.
